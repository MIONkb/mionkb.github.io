## About
I am a Ph.D. student in Electronics Engineering (EE) at the State Key Laboratory of Integrated Circuits and System, Fudan University, supervised by Prof. [Lingli Wang](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/60/3c/c31155a352316/page.htm). My research focuses on **reconfigurable architectures (e.g. CGRAs)** and **AI compiler design**, with a particular emphasis on MLIR-based compilation frameworks, tensor dataflow optimization, and heterogeneous CGRA–CPU systems for AI workloads.

I have published as the first author at **DATE 2024** and **DAC 2025**, and have participated in several national and international competitions related to electronic design and GPU programming.
